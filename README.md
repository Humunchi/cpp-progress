this is me praticing my c++ that I am self studying online.
You've probably seen most if not all of this code before on some tuttorial on line. Mainly I am using Free Code Camp and CodeCademy. 
Thus far I have:
## 1. Using cout to print hello world
## 2. Try Basic Object Oriented Programing 
## 3. App Ideas:
 * a.) Tax app guiding self-employed people on how to file taxes in South Africa.
 * b.) Setswana learning application with word games (similar to Duo)
 * c.) NA  and AA app for finding meetings in your own timezone with sharelibrary and lierature library
 * d.) Social media automation/sheduling
 * e.) A guide for adulting in South Africa covering topics like laws surrounding property rental, what to do if injured or in a car accident, rape and sexual                     harassment,hate speach and racism or any uncontitutional offence. The app will contain a searchable pdf version of The Constitution and numbers to help lines and directories to services. There will also be a place for people who want to donate or voulanteer their time to a civil society cause.  
 * f.) Black youtube (only videos from black creators) 
 * g.) A compilation of all SETA accreited courses to search through according to entrance requirements, institution, cost of study, busaries applicabble, level of study, career paths opened up by the qualification, name of qualification, and reviews by students who have graduated from the specific course of study from the specific institution. If possile it would be worth it to break down the curriculum in as detailed way as possible to be as tranparent as possible to the applicant about what they are getting themselves into. Hopefully this app can help school leaving students to find a course and funding for that course to be able to be of service to ther family, their community and thier country. By helping people reach their highest aspirations in any trade or degree course. Placing the information in the hands of the most remote and underprivalged commun ities in SOuth Africa any child or even gogo can seek the information necessary to improve their own living circustances and in turn those of their family as inshrined in our Consitution. 
 * h.)An app that links publishers with aspiring novelist. The app will help the author show their work to a financer a publisher without loosing the right to the intelectual property. The protection of the intellectual property of authors and writers is the primary objective.
 * i.) University article review and editing application. 
 * j.) Market speculation application. You can sell and by automatically by setting price points
 * k.) Recipie generator app. You input the ingredients you have then get recipie suggestions. You can also upload your own recipies to refer back to them.
 * l.) Doctor appointment booking application. You can input your patient number, email and passowrd to see your upcoming and passed appointments, doctors notes, test results, prescriptions, and get remineded of up coming appointments via email. An app that streamlines medical administration eliminating hospital and clinic waiting lines and maximizing the care given to patients.
 * m.) A map of potable water, electicity connectedc areas, roads and qualities of  said roads, basically a rating of local municipality and a general resident reported livability of an area. This app will help measure the ammount of access to resources and services payed for by tax payers. Hopefully this application can imporve the levels of living in South Africa and reduce the prevalance of corruption when it comes to service delivery. We could call this application Municipality Report. 
 * n.) Voting access and information with a side game about democracy. 
 
 ### A side note and some aspects to take into consideration during development
 - +Accessability to blind, deaf, 
 - +Language 
 - +Cost (each byte is precious as data costs are astronomical)
